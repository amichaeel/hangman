future plans
todo:
impliment state logic to prevent skipping a word
begin rapid fire page

game modes:
 -- daily word: user will have 10 attempts to guess all letters in the daily word. a win streak will be recorded
    -- to make sure user doesn't refresh to start over, each letter that was entered will be stored in local storage.
    -- if a user refreshes, the script will check for all letters that have been entered.
    -- letters that match the word will be highlighted green and disabled, and letters that aren't a part of the word will be disabled.
    -- guesses remaining will be stored in local storage.
 -- rapid fire: user will have 2 minutes to guess as many words as possible, with 10 attempts each word. high score will be recorded.
 -- casual: a user will have unlimited time to guess a word with only 10 total attempts. a win streak will be recorded.

 game state
 -- if there is no word stored in local storage, fetch new word and begin new game
 -- as user enters guesses, each guess will be stored in local storage (letters)
 -- if user refreshes, game will check for word in local storage, check all letters entered, replace underscores with matching letters, and buttions will be disabled accordingly
 -- guesses remaining will also be fetched from local storage if word is located
